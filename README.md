# Bayesian LSTM Implementation in PyTorch

Inspired to make confident prediction for Time Series (ohlc for stock) using Autogluon and as a second goal (todo), use Bayesian Neural Networks.  
The desirable properties is providing quantifiable uncertainties and confidence intervals, unlike equivalent frequentist methods.

This repository demonstrates an implementation in PyTorch/Autogluon.

Interactive visualizations have not been transferred to GitHub.
